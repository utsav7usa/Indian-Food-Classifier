# Indian-Food-Classifier
AI model to classify Indian foods using Teachable Machine
# Indian Food Classifier

## Overview
This project uses Google’s Teachable Machine to create an AI model that classifies images of Indian foods: Biryani, Dosa, and Samosa. The model was trained on 30+ images per class and achieves ~90% accuracy in testing.

## Tools Used
- Teachable Machine: For no-code AI model training.
- TensorFlow.js: For exporting the model.

## Files
- **Model**: [indian-food-model.zip](./model/indian-food-model.zip) – Trained AI model.
- **Sample Images**: [Biryani](./assets/biryani1.jpg), [Dosa](./assets/dosa1.jpg), [Samosa](./assets/samosa1.jpg).
- **Screenshots**: [Prediction Results](./assets/prediction-screenshot.png).

## How It Works
1. Uploaded 10-15 images per class (Biryani, Dosa, Samosa) to Teachable Machine.
2. Trained the model to achieve ~90% accuracy.
3. Tested with new images to verify predictions.
